2. Click "Add Location"
3. Enter:
   - Location name
   - Address
   - Postcode
   - GPS Coordinates (latitude/longitude)
   - Allowed radius (in meters)

#### B. Create Employees
1. Go to "Employees" menu
2. Click "Add Employee"

## üîß Development Commands

```powershell
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Type checking
npm run check

# Database operations
npm run db:push
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
```powershell
# Check if .env file exists
Get-Content .env

# Check if port 5000 is available
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 5000
```

### Database Connection Issues
```powershell
# Verify DATABASE_URL in .env
# Make sure it starts with postgresql://
# Check Neon dashboard for connection status
```

### Face Recognition Not Working
```powershell
# Verify Python is accessible
python --version

# Check if DeepFace is installed
pip list | Select-String "deepface"

# Test Python script
python server/actual_deepface.py
```

### Camera Access Issues
- Ensure browser has camera permissions
- Use HTTPS in production (required for camera)
- Check if another app is using the camera

## üí° Tips

1. **Face Recognition Works Best When:**
   - Good lighting conditions
   - Face is clearly visible
   - No sunglasses or masks
   - Looking directly at camera

2. **Security Best Practices:**
   - Change default passwords immediately
   - Use strong session secrets
   - Enable HTTPS in production
   - Regular database backups

3. **Performance:**
   - First face recognition is slower (downloads models)
   - Subsequent checks are much faster
   - Consider local caching for models
