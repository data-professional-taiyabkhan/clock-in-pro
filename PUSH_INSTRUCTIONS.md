# How to Push to Your New Repo

GitHub detected old secrets in your commit history and blocked the push.

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix - Allow the Secrets

Since these are old test files and not real production secrets, you can allow them:

### Step 1: Open These URLs in Your Browser

**Allow Azure Face Key:**
```
https://github.com/data-professional-taiyabkhan/clock-in-pro/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/33gNlXpfjKkJOAMXJZcPiINrgWa
```

**Allow Slack Webhook:**
```
https://github.com/data-professional-taiyabkhan/clock-in-pro/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/33gNlXGog1zzpnidlIGEJUqyIBl
```

### Step 2: Click "Allow Secret" on Each Page

### Step 3: Push Again
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

## üîê OR: Clean Push (Remove Secret History)

If you prefer a completely clean repo without the secret history:

### Option A: Fresh Start (Recommended)
```powershell
# Create a new branch without history
git checkout --orphan clean-main

# Add all current files
git add -A

# Create first clean commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Clean attendance management system"

# Delete old main branch
git branch -D main

# Rename clean-main to main
git branch -m main

# Force push to new repo
git push -f origin main
```

### Option B: Use BFG Repo Cleaner
1. Download BFG: https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
2. Run: `bfg --delete-files azure-face-service.ts`
3. Run: `bfg --delete-files semgrep_rules.json`
4. Run: `git push -f origin main`
