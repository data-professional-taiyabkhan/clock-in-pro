## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL database

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd attendance-management-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install deepface numpy opencv-python pillow tensorflow
   ```

3. **Database setup**
   ```bash
   # Set your PostgreSQL connection string
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
   
   # Push database schema
   npm run db:push
   ```

4. **Environment configuration**
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

5. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. **Admin Account**: Create the first administrator account through the registration page
2. **Office Locations**: Set up office locations with GPS coordinates and allowed radius
3. **Employee Invitations**: Send invitation links to employees for account creation

### Employee Onboarding
1. **Direct Account Creation**: Managers create employee accounts directly with default password "password123"
2. **Face Registration**: Managers upload employee face images for recognition
3. **Location Assignment**: Assign employees to specific office locations

### Daily Operations
1. **Clock-In**: Employees use face recognition to clock in at authorized locations
2. **Clock-Out**: Face verification for secure clock-out process
3. **Monitoring**: Managers monitor real-time attendance and approve exceptions
4. **Reporting**: Generate attendance reports and analytics
