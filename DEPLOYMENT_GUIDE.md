npm install -g @fly/cli

# Login
fly auth login

# Initialize
fly launch

# Deploy
fly deploy
```

### **Option 3: Vercel + Railway Split**
- **Frontend:** Deploy to Vercel (fast, free)
- **Backend:** Deploy to Railway (handles Python)
- **Database:** Keep Neon

### **Option 4: Heroku (Paid but Reliable)**

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### Memory Issues
If you get memory errors:
1. **Railway:** Upgrade to Pro ($5/month) for 2GB RAM
2. **Fly.io:** Use shared-cpu-1x (1GB RAM)
3. **Split deployment:** Frontend on Vercel, backend on Railway

### Python Dependencies
Railway auto-installs Python dependencies from `python-requirements.txt`

### Database Connection
Keep using your Neon database - just update the `DATABASE_URL` in Railway
